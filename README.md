# Nautsrankings V2
Use this website to check the Awesomenauts leaderboard online from anywhere! You can find a live version at https://orikaru.net/nautsrankings

# About this code
This codebase is *very* old and it would be probably faster to rewrite it from scratch at this point.

If you want to run it locally, place the code source into a ./standalone/nautsrankings and serve it using any web server.

# Libraries
This project uses jQuery

# Credits
Made by Blatoy from scratch using [Marukyu's](https://github.com/Marukyu/) nauts leaderboard API, inspired by the first version of Nautsrankings made by Josh Medeiros and the in-game leaderboard.
